Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines
information retrieval with text generation.

A RAG system works in two main phases:

1. Indexing:
Documents are split into smaller chunks.
Each chunk is converted into a numerical embedding vector.
These vectors are stored inside a vector database.

2. Retrieval and Generation:
When a user asks a question, the system converts the question into an embedding.
The vector database retrieves the most semantically similar document chunks.
These retrieved chunks are injected into the language model prompt.
The model generates a grounded response based only on the retrieved context.

RAG systems reduce hallucinations and improve factual accuracy
by grounding responses in external knowledge sources.
